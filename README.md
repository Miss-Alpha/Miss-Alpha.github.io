## A/B Testing 
A type of experiment for de-risking choices between two options, such as changes to a website, addition of new features, or wording of email subjects. Steps: picking a metric track, calculating sample size, running the experiment, checking for significance.

## ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) Computer Science 1 
Atomicity
To guarantee that all the steps in a transaction are completed successfully as a group. If any step in the transaction fails, all other steps must fail also. For example, If a user’s payment fails, you don't want to still assign a driver to that user.
Consistency
To guarantee that all the transactions coming through must follow predefined rules. For example,  a transaction must be made by a valid user.
Isolation
To guarantee that two transactions happen at the same time as if they were isolated. Two users accessing the same data won’t change it at the same time. For example, you don’t want two users to book the same driver at the same time.
Durability
To guarantee that two transactions have been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure. For example, after you’ve ordered a ride and your phone dies, you still want your ride to come. Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) 

## Accuracy Statistics 1 
The most straightforward way to measure a classifier’s performance. Accuracy is given as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions. 
Accuracy is often used as the measure of classification performance because it is simple to compute and easy to interpret. However, it can turn out to be misleading in some cases.
This is especially true when dealing with imbalanced data, a scenario when certain classes contain way more data points than the others.

## Activation Function Machine Learning 2 
Two dense layers in Neural Networks with nothing in between are no better than a single dense layer by itself. Dense layers by themselves can never move us out of the world of lines and planes. What we need is something nonlinear which are activation functions. An activation function is simply some function we apply to each of a layer's outputs (its activations). The most common is the rectifier function max(0,x). The rectifier function has a graph that's a line with the negative part "rectified" to zero. Applying the function to the outputs of a neuron will put a bend in the data, moving us away from simple lines. Kaggle 
 

## Ad Hoc Request 
A request for data or an analysis that does not need to be repeated on a weekly or daily basis. Ad hoc requests are tricky because they are unpredictable and they can "steal" time away from scheduled work, like A/B Tests and Dash boarding. We can handle them with ticketing systems.

## Advertising Touchpoints Marketing 1 
All the moments or interactions a potential customer has with your brand's advertising messages. These touchpoints occur throughout the customer journey, from initial awareness to final purchase and beyond.
Customer Journey: This refers to the steps a potential customer takes as they become aware of your product or service, consider it, purchase it, and hopefully become a loyal customer.
Touchpoints: These are the individual interactions or exposures a customer has with your brand's advertising efforts at various stages of the journey.
Pre-purchase:
Social media ads: Seeing eye-catching sponsored content on platforms like Facebook or Instagram.
Search engine ads: Clicking on an ad that appears at the top of search engine results pages.
Online reviews: Reading positive customer reviews about your product or service.
Blog posts: Engaging with informative content about your brand or industry.
Offline advertising: Seeing billboards, print ads, or TV commercials.
Purchase:
Website design: A user-friendly website that facilitates a smooth buying experience.
Product descriptions: Clear and informative product descriptions that highlight features and benefits.
Promotional offers: Discounts or coupons that incentivize a purchase.
Post-purchase:
Customer service interactions: Positive and helpful interactions with your customer support team.
Email marketing: Receiving personalized emails with product recommendations or loyalty programs.
Retargeting ads: Seeing ads for similar products or services after making a purchase.

## Agent Machine Learning 1 
In Reinforcement Learning, an agent interacts with the environment, takes actions, and learns from feedback. Reinforcement Learning 
Imagine a robot learning to navigate a maze. The robot is the agent. It observes its surroundings (the maze), takes actions (move forward, turn left, turn right), and receives rewards (reaching the goal) or penalties (hitting a wall). Over time, the robot learns the optimal path through the maze.

In essence, the agent is the learner, the decision-maker, and the actor in reinforcement learning. It strives to maximize its cumulative reward by learning from its interactions with the environment. Gemini

## API SQL 
A temporary name assigned to a column or a table.

## API Computer Science 
A set of protocols and routines for building and interacting with software applications.

## Artifact Machine Learning 1 
A file generated during an experiment - examples of artifacts can be files that show the loss curve, evaluation loss graph, logs, or intermediate results of a model throughout a training process. This enables you to compare different experiments and choose the best suited for your needs. Designing Machine Learning Systems
A common ML term used to describe the output created by the training process. The output could be a fully trained model, a model checkpoint (for resuming training later), or simply a file created during the training process such as an image generated while training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

## Artificial Intelligence 1 
Ability of machines to mimic the cognitive abilities and problem-solving capabilities of human intelligence. 

## Attention LLM 1 
Adds context to the text.

## Attention Mechanism  Machine Learning 
An attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve the performance of models by focusing on relevant information. It allows models to selectively attend to different parts of the input data, assigning varying degrees of importance or weight to different elements.
Attention mechanisms work by generating attention weights for different elements or features of the input data. These weights determine the level of importance each element contributes to the model's output. The attention weights are calculated based on the relevance or similarity between the elements and a query or context vector.

The attention mechanism typically involves three key components:
Query: Represents the current context or focus of the model.
Key: Represents the elements or features of the input data.
Value: Represents the values associated with the elements or features.

The attention mechanism computes the attention weights by measuring the similarity between the query and the keys. The values are then weighted by the attention weights and combined to produce the final output of the attention mechanism.

Transformer: Attention mechanism is a fundamental component of the transformer architecture, which has been widely adopted for various tasks.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs also incorporate attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the sequential input data.
Self-Attention: Self-attention is a variant of attention mechanism where the input elements are attended to within the same sequence, enabling the model to capture dependencies within the input itself.

## Attrition Rate 1 
The pace at which people leave a company. Essentially, the attrition rate measures how many people leave, voluntarily or involuntarily. It's usually expressed as a percentage and used as one of the main figures HR tracks to understand how things are going at a company. 

## Autocorrelation Statistics 1 
Refers to the degree of correlation of the same variables between two successive time intervals. It measures how the lagged version of the value of a variable is related to the original version of it in a time series. Autocorrelation, as a statistical concept, is also known as serial correlation.

## AutoML Machine Learning 1 
Automating the process of finding ML algorithms to solve real-world problems. One mild form, and the most popular form, of AutoML in production is hyperparameter tuning.

## Availability Computer Science 1 
Higher availability in the context of computing and IT systems, refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible for a higher percentage of time, minimizing downtime and ensuring that services are consistently available to users.
